1.Robot is a Java Class
2.Selenium-based test automation framework uses it for simulating the keyboard and mouse events.
3.It can automate desktop popups also.
4.To handle native OS pop-ups we need Robot class.
5.Example:
	For instance, if you are trying to download Email Attachment, Windows pop-up, 
    'Save Attachment' prompts to specify Download Location, appears. It is nothing 
	but a native OS pop-up.
6.Desktop windows pop-up will not have locators so actions class cannot help.

ROBOT:
	1. This class is used to generate native system input events.
	2. This class uses native system events to control the mouse and keyboard.
	3. Pre-defined methods : keyPress(), keyRelease(), mousePress()
						     mouseMove(), mouseRelease(), mouseWheel()
						     delay(), createScreenCapture().
						     
** While using ROBOT class better to used try- catch block. They usually throw checked exceptions
   like AWTExceptions
